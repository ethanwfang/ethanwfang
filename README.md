### <h1>Ethan Fang</h1>
<h3>About Me</h3>

My name is Ethan and I am an undergraduate student at Case Western Reserve University. I am pursuing a BS/MS degree, finishing my Bachelor's degree in 2025, and Master's in 2026. My major concentration will be in AI and Algorithms & Theory

I am interested in full-stack development (front-end), data science, deep learning, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.  I have a strong background in data science and data analysis, and I am adept in communication to achieve business objectives. 

I am currently working on creating Deep Learning models in image analysis for SDLE.
