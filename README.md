### Profile
I am an undergraduate student at CWRU studying computer science and mathematics. I am heavily interested in math theory, machine learning, and quant research.

As I dive deeper into ML, I am documenting my progress as I learn in my "Intro to ML" repo (pinned). I am currently working on Palo.ai, an intelligent virtual assistant enhancing corporate workflow. 

This Fall 2024 semester, a few classmates and I lauched CWRUQuants, Case's first and only quantitative finance club.
