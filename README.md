### <h1>Ethan Fang</h1>
<h3>About Me</h3>

My name is Ethan and I am an undergraduate student at Case Western Reserve University. I am pursuing a BS/MS degree, finishing my Bachelor's degree in 2025 (concentration in artificial intelligence and software engineering), and my Master's Degree in 2026. 

I have a strong background in data science and data analysis, but I would love to learn more about honestly any topic.

I am currently working on creating deep learning models using keras and Tensorflow at the Solar Durability and Lifetime Extension Center, 
a research institution part of the Great Lakes Energy Institute on campus. I am mostly doing the data cleaning work, but am creating
scripts for automation of the cleaning process.
