<h3>ðŸŒ±About Me</h3>

My name is Ethan and I am an undergraduate student at Case Western Reserve University. I am pursuing a BS/MS degree, finishing my Bachelor's degree in 2025 with a concentration in AI and Software Engineering. Then, I will complete my Master's Degree in CS by 2026. I plan to go to grad school for Financial Engineering after obtaining my Computer Science Masters. <br><br>

I am also involved on campus as the Vice President of CWRU Club Tennis. Last year, I played in the CWRU Symphony Orchestra as a 1st violinist, and I plan to play in a Quartet this upcoming semester after taking a break due to a course conflict (boo!!). I've played tennis and violin my entire life, and I'm happy that I am able to continue these passions in college.

<h3>ðŸ”­Experience</h3>
From October 2022 to September 2023 I worked at SDLE, a materials science research lab on campus, on a computer vision XRay Diffraction (XRD) project. My job there was to create a script that would segment alpha and beta rings from 2-Dimensional XRD images. Then, I would use the obtained information to generate data about the XRD using a custom ellipse-fitting algorithm, which would prove useful to several national labs working on XRD around the United States. You can find the published XRD package (I generated the entire documentation using docstrings, ReadTheDocs, and sphinx) at <a href = "https://pypi.org/project/XRDimage/#description">this link.</a> In this project, I learned a lot about machine learning algorithms and using Python libraries such as scikit-learn, keras, tensorflow, numpy, pandas, and pytorch. <br><br>

Starting in August 2023, I started an internship with Progressive Insurance (Flo fan since day 1!). Here, I am working in a team of 7 other contracted students from Case. We are developing a software solution to manage frontline employee stress. I am working on an employee-manager chat feature using React.js and Typescript for frontend, and DataPlug and MongoDB for backend.  <br><br>

I'm currently looking for any roles for Winter/Spring and Summer 2024. I am interested in data engineering, software development, and financial/risk analyst positions.
