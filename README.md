### Profile
I am an undergraduate student at CWRU studying computer science and mathematics. I am heavily interested in math theory, machine learning, and quant research.

As I dive deeper into ML, I am documenting my progress as I learn in my "Intro to ML" repo (pinned). 

### Experience
- MISCO Refractometer
  - Data Analysis and Process Flow Engineering
- Kernel Pruning Lab
  - CNN unstructured pruning algorithms, quantization testing
- Solar Durability and Lifetime Extension Center 
  - Worked on 2 teams here. First year was spent doing <a href = "https://pypi.org/project/XRDimage/">computer vision research</a> on XRD data. My second year was spent doing anomaly detection
    on Windows Logging Service data using GNNs.
