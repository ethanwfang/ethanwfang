### <h1>Ethan Fang</h1>
<h3>About Me</h3>

My name is Ethan and I am an undergraduate student at Case Western Reserve University. I am pursuing a BS/MS degree, finishing my Bachelor's degree in 2025, with a concentration in artificial intelligence and software engineering, and my Master's Degree in 2026. 

I have a strong background in data science and data analysis, but I would love to learn more about honestly any topic.

I am currently working on creating deep learning models using keras and Tensorflow.
