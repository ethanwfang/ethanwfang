### Hey!👋

My name is Ethan and I am an undergraduate student at Case Western Reserve University. I am pursuing a BS/MS degree, finishing my Bachelor's degree in 2025, and Master's in 2026. 

I am interested in data science, deep learning, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. My major concentration will be Algorithms and Theory, as well as Artificial Intelligence. I have a strong background in data science and data analysis, and I am adept in communication to achieve business objectives.
