### Profile
I am an undergraduate student at CWRU studying computer science and mathematics. I am heavily interested in math theory, machine learning, and quant research.

As I dive deeper into ML, I am documenting my progress as I learn in my "Intro to ML" repo (pinned). I am currently working on Palo.ai, an intelligent virtual assistant aiming to address an issue in corporate companies. 

A few classmates and I are launching CWRUQuants, a quantitative finance club at Case Western Reserve University. Our goal is to bring people together to learn and develop skills at the intersection of mathematics, finance, and computer science.
